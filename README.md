Advanced Web Development Endterm Project (Django Social Network Web Application)

Implemented a social media application that allows user to register an secured account, upload post, follow user existing in the application, and have a real time chat with their friends. 

My application is a mimic of the “Facebook” application that allows user to share their day and discoveries online with their friends and follower. The users gets to interact with the other users through following and chatting. If the users follows each other, then they would be friend and unlocks the chat requirements. 

I implemented this application by using all of the knowledge that I have learned in this course such as RESTful, WebSocket, Authentication, model, database, testing and etc.
